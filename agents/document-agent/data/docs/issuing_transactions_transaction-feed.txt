## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
An API key or the API Explorer
A card product, financial account, and payment card
Optional - Real or simulated transactions

## Financial account activity

Financial account activity is recorded in the Highnote ledger. To build a transaction feed for your account holders, you can query a financial account to return its account activity and associated ledgers. Building transaction feeds against a financial account ensures financial account activity carries across all payment cards associated with the financial account.

Note the following when querying for financial account activity:

For financial accounts with no activities: The Highnote API returns four specific ledgers, CASH, AVAILABLE_CASH, CREDIT_OUTSTANDING, AVAILABLE_CREDIT.
For financial accounts with activities: The Highnote API only returns ledgers that have at least one activity on them.

CASH

AVAILABLE_CASH

CREDIT_OUTSTANDING

AVAILABLE_CREDIT

Use the following query to return financial account activity:
