## Overview

The Highnote Query Language (HQL) v.1.0.0 provides programmatic search capabilities across Highnote entities using SQL-like syntax through the GraphQL API.

Specifically, HQL enables complex searches that would normally require multiple standard GraphQL requests:

transactionAmount > USD 500 AND createdAt >= '2024-01-01'

accountId IN ('ac_ba22446a041287274d81af25bb83eeba46b1', 'ac_c022126bc2bb629545a988564e267d8982a5')

customField='riskLevel:high'

(accountStatus = 'ACTIVE' OR accountStatus = 'PENDING') AND productId = 'pd_4644868cd7b749fa82a4149d46d9827d'

The API processes HQL queries through three main search contexts: Financial Accounts, Payment Transactions (acquiring), and Universal Transactions (issuing), each exposing context-specific searchable fields alongside common attributes.

HQL operates through the searchQueryLanguage field within GraphQL filterBy inputs:

## Limitations

HQL is a standalone filter system that uses the searchQueryLanguage field within filterBy inputs. If provided with other standard filters, HQL takes precedence and the other filters are ignored.

filterBy

Minimum API version: The minimum supported Search API version is VERSION_1.

VERSION_1

Rate limits:  See API Rate Limiting for details.

Search latency: Highnote’s Search API has a latency period of up to two minutes.

## HQL Conventions

The Highnote Query Language uses the following conventions:

A term is a keyword used to search on attributes related to an entity.
An expression is <term> <operator> <value>. For example, transactionAmount > USD 100.
A value with special characters must be escaped with single quotes. For example, Highnote identifiers include an underscore and should be represented as  'ac_c022b9c66de3299c4f06a03293106c65234b'.

<term>

<operator>

<value>

transactionAmount > USD 100

accountId != 'ac_ba22446a041287274d81af25bb83eeba46b1'

>

transactionAmount > USD 100

>=

transactionAmount >= USD 100

<

transactionAmount < USD 100

<=

transactionAmount <= USD 100

IN

accountId IN ('ac_ba22446a041287274d81af25bb83eeba46b1', 'ac_c022126bc2bb629545a988564e267d8982a5')

AND

transactionAmount > USD 100 AND accountId = 'ac_ba22446a041287274d81af25bb83eeba46b1'

OR

( )

last4 = 1234 AND (accountId = ‘ac_ba22446a041287274d81af25bb83eeba46b1’ OR accountId = 'ac_c022126bc2bb629545a988564e267d8982a5')
