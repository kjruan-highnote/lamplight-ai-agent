## Overview

Request complexity refers to the computational cost and resource usage of executing a GraphQL query. Because GraphQL lets clients request deeply nested and complex data structures in a single query, complexity must be managed to avoid overloading the server.

## Scoring complexity

Common factors that increase complexity are operation, depth, and type. For example:

Operation: Mutations are often more complex than queries due to data writes and consistency requirements.
Depth: Deeply nested queries are more complex than shallow ones.
Type: Objects with multiple fields or relationships to other objects are more complex than primitive types such as scalars.

Highnote manages the complexity of its GraphQL API with complexity scoring, rate limiting, and pagination.

## Type and pattern costs

Query operation types are scored as follows:

Query: Query cost is based on the types and fields requested.
Mutation: Mutations have a base cost of 10, plus any additional costs based on the types and fields requested.

Other types and patterns are scored as follows:

Note: The fields cursor and pageInfo are intrinsic to the connection pattern and have no separate complexity cost.

## Nested example

The following example demonstrates a more complex request complexity calculation that includes nested connection objects to illustrate how pagination cost can multiply:

## Testing request costs

The asOf parameter is the UTC timestamp for when this was calculated, to account for staleness during long requests.

Every Highnote GraphQL API response includes the request cost under the extensions field. We recommend that you test the cost of your queries in the API Explorer.

The following example represents a request cost response in an API request that is not rate-limited:
