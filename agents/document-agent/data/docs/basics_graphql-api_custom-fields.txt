## Overview

Warning: For compliance and security reasons, do not use custom fields to store PCI or PII data.

Financial account and payment card objects implement custom fields that let you to add key-value pairs to the object.

Each Highnote CustomFields object is a set of key-value pairs stored and returned in plain text. Limits are:

CustomFields

You are allowed a maximum of 20 CustomFields objects.
Each key is an alpha-numeric string with a maximum of 40 characters.
Each value is an alpha-numeric string with a maximum of 255 characters.

CustomFields

Use cases for using custom fields include:

Linking IDs in your system with Highnote data
Marking notes on Highnote data
Adding a nickname to a card
Tagging an account with the application ID
Searching for objects relating to a customer in your system

## Query custom fields

You can use the following node query to find customFields on a financial account:

customFields

## Search multiple objects

You can also use a nodeByCustomFields query with a CustomFieldsFilter to look up multiple objects and their custom fields. Use the following query to search multiple objects:

nodeByCustomFields

CustomFieldsFilter

## Filters

In addition to using the customFields filter to search multiple objects, you can use the following filters to refine your search results:

customFields

Accepts one input

equals
notEquals

equals

notEquals

Accepts one or more inputs

includes
excludes

includes

excludes

## Example 1: Equals

The following code snippet provides an example of using the equals filter in your query input:

equals

## Example 2: Not equals

The following code snippet provides an example of using the notEquals filter in your query input:

notEquals

Copy code snippet

## Example 3: Includes

The following code snippet provides an example of using the includes filter in your query input:

includes

Copy code snippet

## Example 4: Excludes

The following code snippet provides an example of using the excludes filter in your query input:

## Create custom fields for new object

Note: Currently, objects that support custom fields are FinancialAccount and PaymentCard.

FinancialAccount

PaymentCard

You can create custom fields when creating a new object that supports customFields.

customFields

The following mutation provides an example of creating a FinancialAccount with customFields key-value pairs entered as input variables:

FinancialAccount

customFields

## Update custom fields of existing object

Warning: Setting a key-value pair's value to empty will delete the key.

You can add, update, or delete customFields of an existing object with the UpdateCustomField mutation and by referencing key-value pairs explicitly as input variables.

customFields

UpdateCustomField

## Example 1: Add fields

The following example uses the UpdateCustomFields mutation to add multiple customFields key-value pairs to an existing object:

UpdateCustomFields

customFields

## Example 2: Add, update, delete fields

Continuing from the previous output, the following example uses the UpdateCustomFields mutation to do the following:

UpdateCustomFields

Delete a key-value pair (regionId)
Update another key-value pair (customerGroupId)
Add a new key-value pair (sectorId)

regionId

customerGroupId

sectorId

## Delete custom fields

You can use the following mutation to delete all customFields for an object without having to specify the keys explicitly:

customFields
