==================================================

## Overview

Note: The secure inputs SDK for tokenization is a more customizable checkout solution. For a simpler, drop-in solution, use the Checkout SDK.

The Highnote Secure Inputs SDK can be used to tokenize payment method details so you can process payments in your application or website.
This prevents PCI-scoped data from flowing through your servers or being accessible to scripts running on your page.

## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
A server-side integration using an API key
Payment card ID

## Installation

The Highnote Secure Inputs SDK follows semver and can be installed using the following:

JavaScript package manager: npm, yarn, or pnpm
Content Delivery Network (CDN) via traditional <script> tag or ECMAScript module.

npm

yarn

pnpm

<script>

## Install by package manager

Installation steps are the same for both the PIN and tokenization Secure Inputs SDKs.

The Secure Inputs SDK supports the following JavaScript package managers: npm, yarn, and pnpm.

npm

yarn

pnpm

## Install by CDN

To ensure stability and avoid potential issues caused by updates, replace @latest with a specific version number such as @1.0.0.

@latest

@1.0.0

You can install Secure Inputs SDK directly from a content delivery network (CDN) such as JSDelivr.

The SDK supports both traditional script tags and ECMAScript module imports.
ESM imports require modern browsers.
To support older browsers, use the traditional script tag approach with appropriate polyfills.

## Script tag

To install the Secure Inputs SDK by <script> tag, add the following to your HTML file:

<script>

## ESM imports

To install the Secure Inputs SDK by ESM module, add the following to your HTML file:

## Usage

To render secure input fields in your UI, configure elements to hold each field as follows:

Prepare your HTML
Fetch a client token
Initialize secure inputs.

## Prepare your HTML

To use the Secure Inputs SDK, you must provide elements for the payment details fields.

The following fields are supported for the Secure Inputs SDK for tokenization:

cardNumber
expirationDate or expirationMonth and expirationYear
securityCode

cardNumber

expirationDate

expirationMonth

expirationYear

securityCode

## Fetch a client token

To obtain a client token from your server for the Secure Inputs SDK, use the generatePaymentMethodTokenizationClientToken mutation.

generatePaymentMethodTokenizationClientToken

Refer to the following guidelines when generating a payment method tokenization client token:

The client token is only valid for 10 minutes but can be used multiple times.
Once a token expires, you must generate a new one.

Use the following mutation to generate a payment method tokenization client token:

## Initialize secure inputs

The secure inputs library works by injecting an iframe into the payment element to render the appropriate data. You can style the content inside each iframe by passing any combination of styling options.

You can initialize the card viewer by using a renderFieldsForTokenization function. This returns a Promise that contains a reference to the secureInputs instance. This is useful for lifecycle management and interactions such as field submission.

## Error handling

The Secure Inputs SDK doesn’t render error messages or update your UI inside iframes when errors occur. You must introspect and handle errors accordingly.

You can pass an onError handler to the renderFieldsForTokenization call. This callback will be invoked whenever an error is raised from the integration.

## Error types

The following error types are supported for the Secure Inputs SDK for tokenization:

requestId

## Styling options

The following styling options are available for use in elements for your secure inputs fields:

color

#55f5a3

rgba(85,245,163,1)

#springgreen

cursor

pointer

none

fontFamily

sans-serif

serif

monospace

fontSize

12px

1em

1.1rem

fontWeight

bold

normal

letterSpacing

normal

.2rem

lineHeight

normal

150%

userSelect

none

auto

inherit

## iframe defaults

Highnote injects card viewer iframes with the following defaults. Your CSS styling can override each of these:

border: none
width: 300px (browser default)
height: 150px (browser default)

border: none

width: 300px

height: 150px

The document and body inside the frame will have transparent backgrounds and default to margin: 0, padding: 0

margin: 0

padding: 0

## Custom fonts

The Secure Inputs SDK only supports system fonts.

## Layout

The layout of payment card fields in the card viewer is customizable. Highnote injects iframes into the provided container elements, which will inherit the width of the container. You can customize the width and height of the container to accommodate your UI as needed.

The following code sample provides an example of custom layout styling:

## Using the live environment

By default, the card viewer library will make requests against the test environment. When you are ready to switch to the live environment, set the environment configuration option using the following function call:

## Lifecycle

The Secure Inputs SDK's lifecycle consists of unmounting fields.

If you need to unmount payment card fields, use the unmount method on the returned reference. This is useful when you need to “restart” the integration, or navigate to a new view client-side. Using this will ensure the cleanup of any DOM and event handlers.

unmount

The following code sample provides an example function to unmount fields:

## Content security policy

If your application enforces a content security policy, you must set the frame-src header to allow iframes from the Highnote domain:
