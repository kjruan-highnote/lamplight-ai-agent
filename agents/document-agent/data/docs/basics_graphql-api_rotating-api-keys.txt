## Before you start

We strongly recommend rotating your Highnote API keys every 90 days. The practice of rotating API keys helps mitigate risk associated with unauthorized access and misuse of sensitive data or services.

To rotate your API keys, create new keys and revoke old ones:

Login to the Highnote dashboard.
Click Developers from the left-hand navigation menu.
On the API Keys tab, click Create API Key and follow the prompts. Create multiple API keys if needed.
Copy and store your new API key in a secure place.
Update your applications to use your new API key.
Delete old API keys by clicking Revoke API Key in the Highnote dashboard.
