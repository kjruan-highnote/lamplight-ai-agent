## Before you start

All Highnote API entities use the same search and sorting conventions. You can use the following examples to build your queries when filtering for matches. Results will always return as a paginated list you can traverse using cursors.

## Search latency

Highnote’s Search API has a latency period of up to two minutes. This delay occurs because new objects are initially stored in the main database before synchronizing with the search database. For example, if you create a new account holder, that account holder’s data is not available via the search database for up to two minutes. This process is illustrated in the following graphic:

## Filtering basics

Different fields can filter every entity in our graph. However, all fields of the same type follow similar conventions.

## Date filters

To filter by date range, use the following filters:

greaterThan
lessThan
greaterThanOrEqualTo
lessThanOrEqualTo
equals
notEquals

greaterThan

lessThan

greaterThanOrEqualTo

lessThanOrEqualTo

equals

notEquals

## Number filters

To filter by numbers, use the following filters:

greaterThan
lessThan
greaterThanOrEqualTo
lessThanOrEqualTo
equals
notEquals

greaterThan

lessThan

greaterThanOrEqualTo

lessThanOrEqualTo

equals

notEquals

## String filters

To filter with common string matching, use the following filters:

contains
equals
notEquals
startsWith
endsWith

contains

equals

notEquals

startsWith

endsWith

## List filters

You can filter multiple values by choosing what values to include or exclude from the results. In the following example, the request is filtered to include AUTHORIZATION_EVENT and CLEARING_EVENT:

AUTHORIZATION_EVENT

CLEARING_EVENT

## Enum filters

You can filter enums by including the enum values you wish to include, exclude, or match exactly. In the following example, the request is filtered to equal AUTHORIZATION_EVENT:

AUTHORIZATION_EVENT

## Combine filters

You can combine multiple filters to construct more advanced queries. In the following example, an enum, number, and date filter are used:

## Application search

You can use the Highnote API to search Account Holder applications based on status, updatedAt, and createdAt search fields.

status

updatedAt

createdAt

AccountHolderCardProductApplication

status

updatedAt

createdAt

The following example query would return the first 20 account holder applications with an APPROVED status:

APPROVED
