## Overview

After you create a reward earn rule, you can configure how to redeem rewards. You can do this by using redemption configurations. Each redemption configuration contains units for conversion. For example, you can redeem reward points for an equivalent statement credit. In addition to conversion units, you can configure redemption timelines. They dictate when an account holder can start redeeming rewards.

## Create reward redemption configuration

Reward redemption configurations are used to create reward redemption configurations. You can create a single reward redemption configuration, or multiple configurations of the same type.

For example, you can create one reward redemption configuration for 1x and another for 0.5x. Then, you can use these configurations to offer different redemption rules, with both remaining active at the same time. When redeeming rewards in this scenario, you will reference the REWARD_REDEMPTION_CONFIGURATION_ID for each reward redemption configuration.
