## Overview

You can suspend a financial account for various risk management use cases not addressed by spend rules or velocity controls. Suspending a financial account does the following:

Declines authorizations on all associated payment cards
Blocks issuance or re-issuance of payment cards

Suspending a financial account works by adding a PROGRAM_OWNER_INITIATED_SUSPENSION financial account attribute. To automate your integration, you can subscribe to financial account attribute events.
