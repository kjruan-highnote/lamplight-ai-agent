## Prerequisites

Review Transaction Lifecycle guide
A Highnote account
An API key or the API Explorer
A fleet card product, financial account, and payment card

## Overview

Do not enter production data in the test environment. The Highnote test environment is for exploring features and training. Use only dummy or test data.

Fleet transactions include enhanced data processing during clearing and settling. You can use the Highnote API to simulate fleet transactions in the test environment. Simulating fleet transactions helps test the following use cases and card product settings:

Different merchants
Different merchant category codes (MCCs)
Enhanced data
Authorization advice
Spend rules and velocity controls
Collaborative authorization flow

This guide provides steps for simulating fleet transactions using the Highnote API.

## Simulate an authorization

In the test environment, authorizations are approved or declined based on your card product logic and authorization controls. Highnote offers two types of authorization controls for fleet payment cards:

Controls baked into the EMV chip in the physical card
Controls enforced through Spend Rules and Velocity Controls

EMV chip controls have a product restriction code encoded into the EMV chip to allow fuel purchases and other approved products. The product restriction code may also prevent purchasing non-fleet items, such as food, at fuel stops.

## MCC-based authorization controls

Fleet cards can be restricted to specific purchase types using MCC-based authorization controls. For an overview of MCC-based spend controls, see Configure Spend Rules.

Purchase types are defined as follows for Visa and Mastercard:

All fleet cards must accept fleet/fuel MCCs. It is optional to configure your authorization controls to accept maintenance MCCs. The following tables provide an overview of fleet/fuel and maintenance MCCs for reference:

## via Visa

Use the following query to simulate a fleet authorization with Visa:

## via Mastercard

Use the following query to simulate a fleet authorization with Mastercard:

## Simulate authorization advice

For purchases at Automated Fuel Dispensers (AFDs), the full transaction amount may not be known at authorization. Instead, a $1 or estimated amount is sent for authorization at the time of purchase, and authorization advice is sent to confirm the total amount at a later time.

Simulating authorization advice is optional. Visa supports a real-time clearing program, which does not require authorization advice. We recommend skipping simulating authorization advice in the following scenarios:

Simulating a real-time clearing event
Simulating an in-store pre-pay transaction
Simulating a transaction where the merchant incorrectly did not send authorization advice

## via Visa

Use the following mutation to simulate authorization advice with Visa:

## via Mastercard

Use the following query to simulate authorization advice with Mastercard:

## Simulate clearing

Fleet transactions follow the standard authorization and clearing data flow and include enhanced data specific to the fleet vertical via specialized clearing messages. Visa and Mastercard outline three levels of data for fleet transactions, but they provide the data at different times during the transaction lifecycle. Depending on your card product's card network, your system may receive fleet-specific Level 2 and Level 3 data.

## Level 1 data

Level 1 data contains standard payment network transaction data provided by merchants. This data includes:

Merchant details
Point of Service details
Billing zip code
Total purchase amount
Purchase date

Level 1 data is the same for all transaction types and merchants. No enhanced data is captured or provided at this level.

## Level 2 data

Level 2 data contains enhanced data captured at the point of sale. Level 2 data is always sent at the time a transaction clears. Level 2 transactions have different MCCs based on whether the payment card is used at an Automated Fuel Dispenser or in-store:

Automated Fuel Dispenser MCC: 5542
In-store MCC: 5541

Refer to the API Reference for more information on Visa Level 2 Purchase Data Fields.

## via Visa

Visa sends Level 1 and Level 2 data together clearing events. Use the following mutation to simulate clearing with Visa:

## via Mastercard

Mastercard only sends Level 1 data in clearing events. Use the following query to simulate a clearing with Mastercard:

## Simulate Level 3 enhanced data

Level 3 data contains enhanced transaction data and is generally used to send specific data related to non-fuel products and services. Level 3 enhanced data transactions use the same MCCs as Level 1 and 2 data for AFD and in-store MCCs:

Automated Fuel Dispenser MCC: 5542
In-store MCC: 5541

You can set up a Notification Event to alert you when Level 3 enhanced data has been added to a transaction.

## via Visa

Visa Level 3 data is typically sent between 24 to 48 hours after the transaction takes place. Merchants are not required to report enhanced data for fuel-only transactions.

Level 3 data typically follows an invoice structure with invoice summary information and invoice line item detail information. Refer to the API Reference for more information on Visa Level 3 Enhanced Data Fields.

Use the following mutation to simulate Visa fleet enhanced data:

## via Mastercard

Mastercard defines enhanced data as Level 2 and Level 3 data. Mastercard Level 2 and Level 3 data is sent at the end of the business day (EST).

Level 3 data typically follows an invoice structure with invoice summary information and invoice line item detail information. Refer to the API Reference for more information on Mastercard Enhanced Data Fields.

Use the following mutation to simulate Mastercard fleet enhanced data:

## Automate your integration

To automate your integration, subscribe to the following notification events:

Payment card authorization
Payment authorization and clear
Payment card cleared
Payment card verification
Payment card transaction enhanced data

The details provided in the payloads from these events can be used for the following use cases:

Automate your application or website's transaction processing workflows
Create account holder notifications and alerts
