## Use of cards in marketing and advertising

See the guidelines below. If you have questions about additional standards, partner with Highnote to see if there are any other Card Network-approved variances.

Card Network image must be present.
Payment Card must be clear and legible.
Card Network symbol must be fully visible; a partial Card Network symbol is not permitted
Payment Card image standards mentioned in the Physical Card section apply.
Payment Card image must be approved by Highnote and Partner Bank prior to use in marketing materials
Issuing statement must appear on the same page as the card image.
Acceptance language is to be included on all applicable collateral material except Card Art and Design, Activation Stickers, Envelopes, and other items designated by the partner bank. Example language, “The card may be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted

An account number is optional. If an account number is included, the expiration date and the cardholder name must be present

For Mastercard, if a cardholder name is used, it must be Lee M. Cardholder, and the account number must be 5412 7512 3412 3456.
For Visa, the account number must be 4000 1234 5678 9010, and there is no required cardholder name for Visa.
For Discover, the account number must be 6011 0000 0000 0000, and there is no required cardholder name for Discover.
For Mastercard and Visa, the expiration date should go out at least three (3) years.

Language should clearly be stated to ensure a consumer does not believe a line of credit or something similar is permitted.

Correct usage of applicable terms include: “Maximum value”, “Card value”, “Amount stored in your card account”, “Maximum load on your card” and “Funds available”.
Do not utilize phrases such as “Cash limit,” “Card limit,” and “Prepaid limit.”
