## Overview

Financial accounts hold payment card balances. The funding source for a financial account differs depending on your card product vertical.

The following table provides an overview of the funding source for each card product vertical:

## Transfer methods

Note: Card product cancelation periods and risk and compliance reviews can impact transfer timelines.

The following table outlines the different transfer methods used for funding a financial account, and their associated timelines:

## Cutoff times

Originated ACH transfers have specific cutoff times for processing. Initiating a transfer after the specified cutoff time may result in additional processing time.

Originated next day ACH: If a transfer is initiated before 4 PM EST, it will be processed by the bank the following business day. If initiated after 4 PM EST, the transfer will be processed two business days from initiation.
Originated same day ACH: If a transfer is initiated before 2 PM EST, the bank will process it the same day. If initiated after 2 PM EST, the transfer will be processed the following business day.

All originated ACH transfer methods have a required three business day hold period once the transfer has been initiated and is processing.
