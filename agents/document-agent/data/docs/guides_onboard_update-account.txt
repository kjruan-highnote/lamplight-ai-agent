## Account holder update notifications

When account holder information is updated, Highnote may need to request documents to verify the account holder's identity. To automate your integration and stay notified of identity verification requests, subscribe to the following notification events:

Account holder identity documents requested notification events: Stay notified when an identity verification is requested for an account holder update to kickoff your document upload workflow
Account holder information update notification events: Stay notified when an account holder update is successfully applied to an account

When using an account holder identity documents request event, the DocumentUploadSession referenced by the event can be queried as a node using the IdentityVerificationDocumentUploadSession type, and can also be interacted with via existing mutations to startDocumentUploadSession, createDocumentUploadLink and endDocumentUploadSession. For more information on collecting documents for identity verification, see Collect documents for identity verification.

This guide provides steps for updating account holder information using the Highnote API. For steps on updating account holder information using the dashboard, see Manage account holders.

You can use the Highnote API to update the following account holder information:
