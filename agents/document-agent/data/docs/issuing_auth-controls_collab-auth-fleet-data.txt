## Overview

Highnote provides fleet-specific data from Visa and Mastercard during authorization requests, which can be used to enhance your collaborative authorization decision-making process. For an overview of the collaborative authorization feature, see Collaborative Authorization.

This guide provides an overview of each card network's fleet-specific data, examples of request bodies, and resources to simulate fleet transactions in your test environment.

## Fleet Data

When a cardholder initiates a transaction, Highnote sends a collaborative authorization request to your endpoint that contains transaction data. Fleet collaborative authorization requests contain a field called mastercardFleetData or visaFleetData depending on the network.  You can configure your collaborative authorization flow to use this data in decisioning.

mastercardFleetData

visaFleetData

Note the following about fleet-specific collaborative authorization data:

Fleet data fields may be null if the payment card is not configured to prompt the cardholder or POS did not return fleet information in the authorization message.
Fleet data provided by Visa and Mastercard differ.

## Visa

Note: For an overview of Visa product codes, see the Visa Fleet 2.0 Global Implementation Guide V1.2.

The following data is available for Visa fleet card products:

## Request body

When you receive a collaborative authorization request for a fleet card product, the request body contains fleet-specific data you can use in decisioning. Each request body has network-specific visaFleetData or mastercardFleetData.

## Simulate fleet transactions

To simulate collaborative authorization fleet data, you can use the fleet transaction simulator to simulate transactions in the test environment. For more information, see Simulate Fleet Transactions.
