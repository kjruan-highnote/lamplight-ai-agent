## Overview

For credit, charge, and fleet card products, you can create or update a credit limit for an account holder's financial account based on your underwriting criteria, agreements, and product guidelines. The credit limit establishes a maximum spending limit for a given period, and authorizations exceeding the credit limit will be declined.

Once you have created a credit limit, you can update it as you factor in new information, such as changes in your customers' financial situations. As part of this feature, Highnote tracks the total credit extended to your account holders' financial accounts and ensures the extended credit does not exceed your card productâ€™s limits.

## Set credit limit

Note: Setting or updating a credit limit is an asynchronous process with the Highnote team to ensure your ledger balances and validations are in check.

You can set a financial account's credit limit by providing the financialAccountId and the credit limit you want to assign to the financial account. Your product funding financial account must have funds equal to or exceeding any credit limit you extend to your account holders.

## Update a credit limit

You can increase or decrease a financial account's credit limit by creating a credit limit change request case. Credit limit updates fall into two categories:

Proactive: Requested by you
Reactive: Request by your account holders

Each credit limit update, increase or decrease, proactive or reactive, may have a credit policy associated with your card product. Creating a credit limit change request case triggers the workflows necessary to make an underwriting decision. The underwriting decision for a credit limit update may be executed by your or Highnote, depending on your card program's credit policies.

## Create credit limit change request

To request a credit limit change for a financial account, you must provide:

The financial account ID
The requested change type, increase or decrease

If you are running your own underwriting for credit limit updates, subscribe to the CREDIT_LIMIT_CHANGE_REQUEST_UNDERWRITING_DECISION_REQUESTED notification event to be notified when a credit limit change request is made.

The following mutation can be used to create the credit limit change request:
