## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
Access to an API key or the API Explorer
An account holder with an approved application

## Overview

Highnote offers preprinted, ready-to-use physical cards for on-the-spot distribution to users. Preprinted cards use a placeholder financial account that allows you to issue the card, without it being activated or used right away. Once you have an account holder to assign the preprinted card to, you can reissue a new personalized payment card against the account holder's financial account. This guide provides an overview of issuing preprinted physical cards to account holders.

The following graphic outlines the typically process for issuing preprinted physical cards:

## Issue a financial account

Once you have an account holder with an approved application, you can issue a preprinted financial account to the account holder. A preprinted financial account acts as a placeholder that allows you to issue a preprinted card to an account holder.

## Issue a virtual card

After issuing a preprinted financial account, you can issue a virtual card. Virtual cards are available to account holders immediately for use at online retailers or to add to their digital wallets. By default, all payment cards begin as virtual cards. If you choose to, you can additionally create and send a physical card.

Assign a new temporary preprinted card.
Issue the account holder's personalized payment card using the suspended card's PAN. Do not issue the personalized card using the temporary preprinted card's PAN.
