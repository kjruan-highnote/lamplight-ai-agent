## Overview

Highnote dashboard sessions time out after 15 minutes of inactivity.

The Highnote dashboard is a no-code user interface built on top of the Highnote API. The "Developers" section of the dashboard contains several developer-related controls.

This guide is for developers. Non-technical users should refer to Using the dashboard in the support guide. To access the dashboard, sign up for a new account or log in.

## Test and live environments

The Highnote dashboard lets you switch between test and live environments using the environment drop-down. For a general overview of the test and live environments, see the Using the Highnote dashboard support guide.

## API keys

You can create and manage API keys from the Highnote dashboard. You must have a valid API key to interact with the Highnote API.

We recommend rotating API keys to mitigate risk and misuse of sensitive data. For more information, see Rotating API Keys.

## Create API key

Use the following steps to create an API key:

From the Highnote dashboard, click Developers.
On the API Keys tab, click Create API Key.
Provide an API Key Name and click Create API Key.
Copy your API key and store it in a safe location. For security reasons, we can’t display the API key again.
Once you’ve copied and stored your API key, click I’ve copied my key.

## Revoke API key

Use the following steps to revoke an API key:

From the Highnote dashboard, click Developers.
On the API Keys tab, locate the API key you want to delete.
Click Revoke API Key.
