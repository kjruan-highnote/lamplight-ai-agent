## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
An API key or the API Explorer

## Display a card

You can display a virtual card in your application or website so the account holder can use their card or view their card information. You can use the following options for displaying a virtual card:

For web-based applications that want to show the full card information, including card number and expiration, you can use the Card Viewer SDK.
For native iOS and Android-based integrations, and non-native PCI-compliant environments, you can securely retrieve and display card details from the API with a Client Token.

Use the following ViewPaymentCard query to display a payment card:

## Display a balance

Balances are held in a financial account's ledgers. You can display different ledger balances on your website or application so the account holder can monitor their account balance(s).

To display balances, you can use a FindAccount query to retrieve all ledgers on a financial account. Using the data returned from this query, use the AVAILABLE_CASH or AVAILABLE_CREDIT ledgers to display the financial account's balance.
