## Overview

The Payment Orders API simplifies the Highnote acquiring offering by letting you easily define items for a PaymentOrder and enabling Highnote to manage the payment flow.

PaymentOrder

## Create a payment order

A payment order can be created using createPaymentOrder. This mutation takes catalogItems which are pre-defined by Highnote for your merchant. These items have pre-defined names, descriptions, and amounts. All pre-defined data can be overwritten when invoking the mutation.

catalogItems

catalogItems can take paymentInstructions which define and automate disbursement regarding which accounts get what amounts. Payment Instructions can be defined to disburse a specific amount or a percentage of the itemâ€™s amount. They also require a disburseToId (i.e., a Highnote Node ID) to disburse funds to. Currently only a FinancialAccount ID can be used.

## Charge a payment order with payment method token

Once the payment order has been created, a request to charge a PaymentMethodToken (generated from the Checkout SDK) can proceed by using chargePaymentOrderFromPaymentMethodToken. This mutation returns both the payment order charged and a new PaymentTransaction charging the token for the payment order amount.

## Query a payment order

A PaymentOrder can be queried using the node query, which lists any PaymentTransactions associated with the PaymentOrder.
