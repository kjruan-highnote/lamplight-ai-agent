## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
An API key or API Explorer
A financial account with simulated transactions and an outstanding balance

## Overview

Do not enter production data in the test environment. The Highnote test environment is for exploring features and training. Use only dummy or test data.

Credit and charge card products use ACH transfers to drive repayments on the Highnote platform. For more information on repayments, see Schedule Repayments.

Simulating repayments in the test environment requires the following steps:

Creating a payment.
Updating the status of the transfer.
Processing a transfer.

This guide provides steps for simulating repayments in the test environment.

## Create a one-time payment

Note: Scheduled payments are initiated by the account holder. You can not schedule a payment for an account holder in the live environment.

One-time payments can be scheduled based on a balance amount or a custom amount. A scheduled payment will not be initiated if the financial account has an OUTSTANDING_BALANCE less than or equal to $0.

OUTSTANDING_BALANCE

In the test environment, a transfer ID is generated within 5 minutes of scheduling a payment for today. Use the findScheduledTransferEvent query to find a transfer event ID and simulate changing the status of the transfer:

findScheduledTransferEvent

## Update the transfer status

In the test environment, you can change the status of a fund in transfer from NEW to PROCESSING using the transfer ID. The simulation will allow you to view the impacts to ledgers from initiating a transfer:

NEW

PROCESSING

## Process a transfer

In the test environment, you can change the status of a fund in transfer from PROCESSING to PROCESSED using the transfer ID. The simulation will allow you to view the impacts to ledgers from processing a transfer:

PROCESSING

PROCESSED
