## Overview

Account holders can move funds out of their financial account using both originated ACH and non-originated ACH transfers.

This guide provides steps for moving funds out of Highnote using both transfer methods.

## Transfer methods

Note: Card product cancelation periods and risk and compliance reviews can impact transfer timelines.

The following table outlines the different transfers methods for moving funds out of Highnote, and their associated timelines:

## Cutoff times

Originated ACH transfers have specific cutoff times for processing. Initiating a transfer after the specified cutoff time may result in additional processing time.

Originated next day ACH: If a transfer is initiated before 4 PM EST, it will be processed by the bank the following business day. If initiated after 4 PM EST, the transfer will be processed two business days from initiation.
Originated same day ACH: If a transfer is initiated before 2 PM EST it will be processed by the bank same day. If initiated after 2 PM EST, the transfer will be processed the following business day.

All Originated ACH Debit transfers (funds pulling in) have a required three business day hold period once the transfer has been initiated and is processing.
