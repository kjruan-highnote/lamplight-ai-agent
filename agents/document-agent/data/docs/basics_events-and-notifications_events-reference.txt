## Overview

This guide is a reference for all Highnote notification events. Note the following when using this reference:

Notification events are categorized by domain. For example, the ACH section of this guide houses all notification events related to ACH transfers.
The NotificationEvent object in the Highnote API uses a NotificationEventName field to identify different event types. This field is not always the same name as the object used to create a notification event query.
When creating notification event queries, refer to the event's object in the Highnote API Reference. Each notification event in this reference links out to its corresponding object in the API.
For a description of each notification event, see the corresponding Object reference link in the reference tables in this guide.

## ACH v1

Note: To simplify ACH transfer events and notifications on the Highnote platform, ACH v2 notification events were released in August 2024.

You can upgrade to using ACH v2 notification events at any time. Refer to the Upgrade to ACH v2 notification events guide for more information.
