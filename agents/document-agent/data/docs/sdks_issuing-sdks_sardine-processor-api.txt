## Overview

Contact your Highnote Implementation Manager to enable Sardine Processor Model integration.

Highnote supports a bring-your-own Sardine integration model. Under this approach, you maintain full ownership and management of your Sardine account while allowing Highnote to access your onboarding risk scores.

To enable this parent-child relationship, you must have an active Sardine account and integration. This setup grants Highnote the necessary permissions to act on behalf of your Sardine account for risk evaluation purposes.

## Sardine application sequence

The application proceess with the Sardine Processor is asynchronous and does not block the applicant from seeing the Application Submission Screen.

The sequence of steps for evaluating an application with Sardine is as follows:

Card Applicant: Submit Application
Subscriber Frontend: Initialize Onboarding Flow
Subscriber Backend: Generate Risk Client Token
Subscriber Frontend: Initialize Sardine SDK
Subscriber Frontend: Create Account Holder
Subscriber Backend: Create US Person Account Holder
Highnote: Evaluate Account Holder information
Subscriber Backend: Create Account Holder Card Product Application
Highnote: Assess Onboarding Evaluation Signals and Risk

## Generate risk client token

Generate a client token to create an account holder and associated application with the Highnote GraphQL API.

## Sardine risk level

Using simulated values for Account Holders may result in different application outcomes based on verification of the applicant’s identity. See Simulate Application Review for more information.

You can trigger varying fraud risk levels using the Person Account Holder’s email or the email of the Primary Authorized Person for a Business Account Holder.

Highnote will move the application to APPROVED or IN_REVIEW based on the assessed fraud risk level and verification of the applicant’s identity.
