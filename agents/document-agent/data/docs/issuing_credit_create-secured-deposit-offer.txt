## Overview

With Highnote’s secured deposit card product feature, you can offer secured card products as a counteroffer during the card product application process. Secured deposit offers provide an alternative card product offering for account holders who do not meet the creditworthiness requirements for your unsecured card product.

The secured deposit card product feature works as follows:

An account holder applies for your unsecured card product and is DENIED.
The account holder receives a counteroffer for your secured card product offering and accepts the counteroffer.
When the account holder accepts the counteroffer and their application is approved, an account holder financial account is issued. This financial account has the secured deposit feature attached to it.
After approving the account holder for the secured card product, you collect the secured deposit in your external payment system.
You can use a non-originated ACH transfer to move the account holder's secured deposit to your secured deposit product financial account.
To apply the secured deposit to an account holder's financial account, you can use an internal Highnote transfer to move the funds from your product financial account.
