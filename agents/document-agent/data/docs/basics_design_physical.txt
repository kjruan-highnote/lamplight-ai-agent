## General guidelines

Keep the following general guidelines in mind when designing physical cards:

On-demand cards are printed in Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (CMYK). Designing in RGB may cause inaccurate colors during printing.
Premium cards are printed in CMYK or Pantone Matching System (PMS). Designing in RGB may cause inaccurate colors during printing.
Black should be set to C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100.
The front and back of your card design may be either horizontal or vertical.
The minimum type size is 6pt for optimal legibility.
Avoid border designs that follow the edge of the card.
Keep logos and text 3/32” away from the edges of the card and from required elements, for example, the card’s magnetic stripe, hologram, and signature panel.
