## Prerequisites

A Highnote account
An API key or the API Explorer
An individual card order or group card order

## Overview

Do not enter production data in the test environment. The Highnote test environment is for exploring features and training. Use only dummy or test data.

Before submitting a physical card order, you can validate the card order's shipping address to ensure it is properly formatted and CASS-certified. For more information on shipping address validation, see Validate shipping address.

Highnote provides a simulation for validating a shipping address in the test environment. This simulation can be used to test your card product's physical card order flow and notification events. This guide provides steps for simulating shipping address validation for card orders.

## Simulate valid address

Use the following mutation to simulate a successful address validation:

## Simulate address with changes

You can simulate an address with changes response by using the keyword changed in the streetAddress field of an address validation query.

changed

streetAddress

Use the following mutation to simulate an AddressValidatedWithChangesResult response:

AddressValidatedWithChangesResult

## Simulate incomplete address

You can simulate an incomplete address response by using the keyword incomplete in the streetAddress field of an address validation query.

incomplete

streetAddress

Use the following mutation to simulate an AddressIncompleteResult response:

AddressIncompleteResult

## Simulate invalid address

You can simulate an invalid address response by using the keyword invalid in the streetAddress field of an address validation query.
