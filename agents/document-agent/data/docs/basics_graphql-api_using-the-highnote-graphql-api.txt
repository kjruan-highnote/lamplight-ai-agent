## Before you start

This guide uses a simple cURL command to demonstrate how to query the Highnote API. Our command sends a ping query:

ping

Copy code snippet

A slash \ represents a newline. Also, options can be represented in single-dash format (which you may see throughout the Highnote docs):

\

Copy code snippet

If successful, the ping query returns the following JSON payload (with the rateLimit info removed for simplicity):

JSON

rateLimit

## Headers

The Highnote API requires the following headers:

Content-Type
Authorization

Content-Type

Authorization

## Content type

The Highnote API accepts and returns JSON,  so you must pass a Content-Type header with the value of application/json:

JSON

Content-Type

application/json

Copy code snippet

## Authorization

The Highnote API uses Basic authentication which requires a base64-encoded API key (that is set as the username and does not require a password).

To create a base64-encoded API key:

Create an API key in the Highnote Dashboard. This key is ASCII-encoded. See Creating and Managing API Keys.


Convert your API key from ASCII to base64:

Pass your base64-encoded key with the Authorization header using the Basic scheme:

Pass your base64-encoded key with the Authorization header using the Basic scheme:

Note: Requests with missing or invalid credentials return a 401 Unauthorized response code.

401 Unauthorized

## Request body

The Highnote API accepts POST requests with JSON payloads. Requests include:

POST

JSON

query

mutation

variables

In our ping query example, the request body is on line 4:

ping

Copy code snippet

The following code snippet makes the same simple query.  To run the query, sign in and expand "Variables", then watch the requestId change with each call.

requestId

## Operation name

You can add an operation name (conventionally in PascalCase); for example, we can name our query PingPong:

PingPong

Copy code snippet

## Variables

The ping query doesn't take any arguments, so we cannot use it to test variables; but we can test the node query which does accept them.

ping

node

Query that tries to get a node with id = node_123abc (and which probably returns null):

node_123abc

null

Copy code snippet

Query with the operation name, GetNode

GetNode

Copy code snippet

Query with a variable for the id:

id

Copy code snippet

The following code snippets makes the same query:

## Multiple requests

You can make multiple GraphQL requests in one by providing a single query value with multiple calls as a string, for example, ping and organizations:

query

ping

organizations

Copy code snippet

## Request URL

The Highnote API has a unique URL for its live and test environments. Both environments use a graphql endpoint but with a different subdomain.

graphql

Our sample ping query has a request URL on line 5 for the test environment.

## Status codes

Unlike REST, GraphQL often returns a 200 OK status code even when there are errors. For error handling, the response includes an errors object with detailed information for troubleshooting.  For mutations, request the userError type on the union type for specific details about the failure. See error handling for more information.

200 OK

errors

userError

There are a few non 200 status codes that Highnoteâ€™s GraphQL API returns for the following cases:

200

200 OK

400 Bad Request

errors

401 Unauthorized

5xx

## Response body

You can format the response body in pretty JSON by installing install jq and editing the URL in your cURL command as follows: https://api.us.test.highnote.com/graphql | jq -C '.'

JSON

https://api.us.test.highnote.com/graphql | jq -C '.'

The response body of a query contains the data requested from the API endpoint. A Highnote API response body contains the following in JSON format:

JSON

data

errors

extensions

requestId

rateLimit
