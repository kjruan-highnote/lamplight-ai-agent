## Overview

Credit products support different balance types:

Purchase
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Installments
Cash Advance
Balance transfer

Credit plans provide flexible and configurable terms for credit card products and can define payment structure, interest rate, type, and accrual method, as well as pricing and policy terms per balance type.

The structure of your credit plans should align with the value proposition and pricing strategy of your credit product. For example, your card product might offer purchase and cash advance credit plans with distinct interest rates, rate types, and accrual methods to serve different customer needs.

Credit plans are linked to financial accounts and determine payment obligations on billing statements. While financial accounts can be assigned to various credit plans, the terms must consistently match what was disclosed to your account holders in their Cardholder Agreement.

## Available plans

Highnote currently supports purchase and post-purchase BNPL installment credit plans:

Purchase credit plans form the foundation of Highnote's revolving credit card products. They let you offer your account holders the ability to make flexible payments (above the minimum) while maintaining access to their full credit line.


Installment credit plans are Highnote's Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) option. They let your account holders move cleared transactions from a flexible revolving balance into a structured payment plan with fixed installments.

Create and attach fees if applicable (required for installment).
